Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

// initialize variables
let sum = 0;
let smallFib = 1;
let largeFib = 2;

// loop until a Fibonacci number that exceeds 4,000,000 is reached
while (largeFib <= 4000000) {
  // if the Fibonacci number is even, add it to the sum
  if (largeFib % 2 === 0) {
    sum += largeFib;
  }

  // get next Fibonacci number
  const newFib = smallFib + largeFib;
  smallFib = largeFib;
  largeFib = newFib;
}

// print result
console.log(sum);
